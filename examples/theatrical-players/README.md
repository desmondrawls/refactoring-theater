# Refactoring Exercise: Theatrical Players

This introductory example comes from the first chapter of Martin Fowler's _Refactoring_ (2nd edition). 

> Imagine a company of theatrical players who go out to various events performing plays. Typically, a customer will request a few plays and the company charges them based on the size of the audience and the kind of play they perform. There are currently two kinds of plays that the company performs: tragedies and comedies. As well as providing a bill for the performance, the company gives its customers "volume credits" which they can use for discounts on future performancesâ€”think of it as a customer loyalty mechanism.

* `statement.js` prints the bill
* `plays.json` contains data about the plays
* `invoices.json` contains data for bills

### Solo Activity

#### Instructions
Clone the repo, create a branch of your own, and take a crack at refactoring it to your satisfaction. As you do so, make note of any refactoring techniques you use (commits can be a nice way to organize your work). **A catalog of refactorings is available [here](https://refactoring.com/catalog/).**

Feel free to do anything that feels healthy or interesting to you: writing tests, modifying the folder structure, changing the language, or anything else you can imagine. 

Push your branch to the remote so we have an opportunity to share our work asynchronously.

###Group Activity
Same deal, but with a group.
